The players file you upload should be a comma separated text file.
<br/> 
For tournaments with multiple groups, the players file would contain two columns: player name and 
the group name where the player belongs to. The columns are separated by a comma. Example:

<pre>
Jessen Michael Aiji Pranata ,Champion
Sutjipto Susilo,Champion
Andrey Esipenko, Champion
Susanto Megaranto, Challenger
Edson Maxy Wiryanto,Champion
</pre>

For simultaneous displays, or tournaments with a single group, the players file would contain 
<strong>only 
the players names column</strong>. 

<br/>
After you you click Submit, the upload process will lead you to a preview page where you can 
recheck the player names and resolve names ambiguity if any. The upload process will try to match
the uploaded names with the existing names already in the database.
